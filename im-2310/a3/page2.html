    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    <p>Doodle Me is an innovative and interactive website that allows users to express their creativity through digital drawing. Doodle Me offers a user-friendly interface and a variety of tools, such as a choice of pastel colours, an eraser, customizable brush sizes, colour selection, and canvas filling, that inspire people to express their artistic flair. This paper will go into the design decisions that went into Doodle Me, emphasising its lighthearted aspect and effective use of feedback to improve the overall interaction design.</p>
        
       <p> Doodle Me was designed to provide users with a straightforward and pleasurable drawing experience. Pastel colours were specifically chosen since they are frequently connected to imagination, creativity, and playfulness. A study in the Journal of Environmental Psychology found that people are more relaxed and have better moods when they are surrounded by pastel colours (Ou et al., 2018). Doodle Me uses these colours to create a visually appealing and peaceful atmosphere in which users can explore their artistic abilities.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, the inclusion of an eraser and adjustable brush sizes offers users greater control over their drawings. This design decision allows for easy corrections and modifications, empowering individuals to experiment with different styles and techniques. The ability to change the color of the paint and fill the canvas with a chosen color adds versatility to the drawing process, enabling users to create visually striking compositions. These design features give users a sense of agency and ownership over their creations, enhancing their engagement and motivation.</p>
        
        <p>Principle of Interaction Design: Playfulness and Feedback
            Playfulness is one of the fundamental interface design elements used in Doodle Me. The website encourages joy and creativity by adopting a playful and enjoyable approach to drawing. User involvement and satisfaction have been found to rise when designs are playful (Desmet & Hekkert, 2007). Doodle Me invites users to explore, experiment, and have fun during the drawing process by incorporating interactive components such as colour selection, brush modifications, and canvas fills.</p>

        <p>Doodle Me also effectively uses user feedback to improve the overall user experience. According to Preece et al. (2019), feedback is essential to interaction design since it informs users of the effects of their actions and aids in their understanding of the system's reaction. When choosing a colour, altering the brush size, or filling the canvas, users of Doodle Me get quick visual feedback. A fluid and responsive sketching experience is produced by this real-time feedback, which strengthens the link between the user's inputs and the system's response.</p>
        
        <p>In summary, Doodle Me is a fascinating and engaging website that gives visitors a fun and enjoyable drawing experience. Doodle Me enables people to explore their creativity and express themselves artistically by integrating elements like pastel colours, configurable brush sizes, colour selection, and canvas filling. Doodle Me's design choices were thoughtfully considered to offer users a simple and engaging platform for digital drawing. The website's whimsical nature paired with efficient feedback mechanisms results in an engaging interface design that sparks creativity and promotes active user participation.</p>
