    <div class="container">
      <div class="item1"> these colours chosen show an ombre effect, going from a very dark purple to a very light purple or pink</div>
      <div class="item2"> the reason these colours were chosen as ombre is minimal but it also carries enough of its own visual impact </div>
      <div class="item3">i also decided on this colour palette as ombre is timeless and classic but also extremely customisable. </div>
      <div class="item4"> I also feel like the colourscheme purple feels refined and royal like but also modern and hip.   </div>
      <div class="item5">As well as those points, i personally just like the colour purple as i find it visually appealing to the eye</div>
      <div class="item6"> I decided to choose the refrence image "hedra page 29" as i was drawn to the simplicity but also the neatness and the style of the way it has been laid out. the grid boxes are small at the begining and then becomes extremly large which demonstrates that something dangerous or really important has come about shifting our focus to this last box.    </div>
